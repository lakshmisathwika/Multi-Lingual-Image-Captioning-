Multi-Lingual Image Captioning generates natural language descriptions of images using deep learning, specifically an encoder-decoder framework with an Xception (CNN) encoder and a BI-LSTM decoder. This approach allows for captions in multiple languages and is applied to the Flickr 8k dataset, aiding in image search engines, accessibility tools for the visually impaired, automatic image tagging, and social media understanding.
